## Current Application Flow

1. Users land on the homepage and can sign in with Google
2. After authentication, users are directed to the dashboard
3. From the dashboard, users can:
   - View their Google Search Console properties in the website selector
   - Select websites to analyze (selection persists via localStorage)
   - Navigate to the Page Audit section to view page performance
   - Access the AI Writer tool to optimize content directly from the page audit
4. The application remembers the user's selected website across sessions

## API Integration

- Google Search Console API for website analytics data
- Content scraping API for the AI Writer feature

## UI Components

- Responsive navigation
- Website selector dropdown with localStorage persistence
- Analytics filters and data tables
- Theme toggler for light/dark mode
- Rich text editor with markdown support

## Next Steps

The application has a solid foundation with authentication, basic dashboard, page audit, and AI writer features. Future development should focus on:

1. Expanding AI capabilities for content optimization
2. Implementing A/B testing features
3. Adding more detailed analytics and reporting
4. Enhancing the content editor with SEO-specific tools
5. Further improving the user experience with refined UI transitions and interactions
