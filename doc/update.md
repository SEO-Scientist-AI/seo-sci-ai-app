### Website Selection System Enhancements

#### Changes Implemented
- **Added localStorage persistence**: The application now remembers the user's selected website across browser sessions using localStorage
- **Removed cookie-based storage**: Eliminated server-side cookies for website selection in favor of client-side only storage
- **Improved WebsiteSelector UI**: Enhanced the website selector to always display in the navigation bar
- **Better user experience for first-time users**: Added clear UI for selecting a website when none is selected

#### Implementation Details
- Added `saveWebsiteToLocalStorage()` and `getWebsiteFromLocalStorage()` utility functions
- Updated the WebsiteSelector component to use localStorage for persistence
- Modified the server-side `getCurrentWebsite()` function to rely only on URL parameters
- Website selection now follows a clear priority:
  1. URL parameters (for direct links and bookmarks)
  2. localStorage (for returning users)
  3. Prompt to select a website (for new users)

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Changes Implemented
- **Fixed AI Writer link behavior**: Modified the AI Writer link in page audit to open in the same tab instead of a new tab
- **Enhanced website selection UI**: Added clearer messaging when no website is selected
- **Improved navigation experience**: Ensured consistent navigation patterns throughout the application

#### Technical Details
- Changed `window.open()` with `_blank` target to `window.location.href` for in-app navigation
- Updated all website selection UI components to provide clearer user guidance
- Added descriptive messages about persistence to inform users their selection will be remembered
